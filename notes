- we should only stick with rgh, sand, fairway

Yes — but implicitly.
Gaussian Processes are inherently regularised. Here’s how:

The RBF kernel has a hyperparameter: length_scale, which controls smoothness.

The model automatically optimises this hyperparameter by maximising the marginal likelihood (a built-in form of model evidence that balances fit vs complexity).

This is a kind of regularisation. It avoids overfitting by penalising too much complexity — similar in spirit to ridge regression or other Bayesian models.
